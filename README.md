# Motivation
Why TRS updates rarely happen and general sentiments towards ro football (from my perspective)

If you know me, then you'll know that I've never really enjoyed playing MPS. I've never been good at playing MPS nor do I want to commit time into improving my skill in MPS. In fact, the only ro football game I've ever enjoyed is TPS. I think that TPS does a very good job at making gameplay more 'flexible' in a way if that makes sense, unlike MPS which is very 'stiff'. Being able to dribble in the air, combine different actions to create different forces to the ball, the general fluidity of the ball when hit and the animations all combine to make such an enjoyable game. However, there are a lot of problems with TPS which makes it sometimes unplayable and annoying to play at times, issues that MPS doesn't have. Despite all of the issues though, TPS is still far more enjoyable than MPS.

My first real taste of MPS was RSU, and it's the one of the only MPS games that I ever enjoyed playing. I remember so many funny memories from scrims inside that pitch. After I stopped actively playing RSU, I moved onto making exploits for ro football games. Making exploits was my first experience with programming, and while the exploits were usually of a low quality, it was fun finding ways to mess up random pitches and troll in scrims. While my scripts were usually of a low quality, since I was the only person in the ro football community making scripts at the time, I made a lot of robux selling scripts which usually took me around an hour to make, around 15k in total over a 5 month period. This was also my first experience making robux on my own. No longer did I have to go onto those robux websites and do surveys for a total of 100 robux each. The relatively slow but steady flow of robux motivated me to continue making scripts, even though I was getting quite annoyed at people dming me every single day with some stupid question around the end stages of me selling exploits. Why I stopped however was because my biggest selling script (the universal HBE script) being leaked. It was bound to happen, and even I knew it was going to happen at some point when I continued to sell scripts. I couldn't be bothered to obfuscate the script every single time someone dmed me asking to buy the script so I simply sent them the full src everytime they bought. Even though I was self aware that it was going to be leaked one day, I was still angry when I found out. Why would people buy it if they could just find the free leaked version somewhere else? I tried to salvage the situation by quickly obfuscating the script and introducing a key system, however the damage was done. I quickly noticed the sales dropping and didn't know what to do. This is when my first drop of motivation happened in programming happened. I decided to stop making exploits for the most part and idly collecting sales from whoever still wanted to buy.

A few months later with nothing interesting happening I suddently got an urge to code again, however I wanted to create a game this time. Here comes [MPS 5 a side](https://www.roblox.com/games/8126978770/MPS-5-A-Side-DISCONTINUED). This game had different uncopylocked MPS game assets all sewn together which culminated in a buggy mess. This was like Frankenstein if he was a roblox game's code base. The stuff that I did write in worked sometimes, like the player rating system. It's very basic but I thought it was pretty cool at the time. Keep in mind, this game was made before getting your league's source code leaked was an inevitability. My only experience of a game's codebase was viewing TPS's countless fixer scripts and the countless s4nchez MPS uncopylocked forks which come up when you look them up on the experience page, which explain how messy it is. While I was motivated at the start of this project, after around a few days I got very bored very quickly and I decided to just release with all the bugs still currently in. Keep in mind I only worked on the game for around 2 hours a day. Obviously, the game ended up failing and I once again went quiet for a few months.

After all this, it had only been around a year since I started programming, but even then it was all very basic things and very on and off. I was around mid 13 when I first started making exploit scripts and now early 14 when Demofocus came in. I remember he sent a TPS 13/14 remake Tayfun sent him and he was revamping it. I was interested and joined the server where he posted updates on it. We didn't really do too much together until he posted some bug with UI that was happening and I suggested a fix to it. He tried the fix and then it worked. After that, he started dming me whenether he had a problem he wanted to solve but couldn't figure out how to. I was pretty interested in the project and thus I helped even sometimes it was quite annoying trying to explain things to him sometimes. The problem with this was that he couldn't team share the game with me or something so I could write in fixes manually since Tayfun didn't let him and so he continually had to post snippets of code and I would suggest a change and wait for a response and then get an update on whether it worked or not. Obviously, this was very counter productive and eventually I assume demofocus' motivation for the project dropped. We then moved onto making a new mps project since with that way, I could code and make UI on my own without having to rely on him to do my changes. This project was worked on for about a month I think before being abandoned due to a lack of motivation again.

Once again, fast forward a few months and Demofocus dms me again, asking me to help him and jaiden (now mmp owner) create a public mps pitch. I was quite bored and accepted the offer. I worked on the game for a few days before we released it. This game was TRS (called MPS Match Pitch originally). After the release I decided to play a scrim on the pitch and thus, pinged as many servers I was admin in to join the game for a scrim. This decision turned out to be crucial in the initial success of TRS. Immediately, around 10 people joined the pitch and we all played a match. While 10 people seems like not a lot of people, at the time there were really only 2 popular MPS games (mps 4 a side and mps futsal) and so TRS quickly shot up to the top of the search page when you looked up TRS for a few hours. With more people seeing a new decently popular (at the time) MPS game, naturally they joined. With scrims happening every day (in a public server) people constantly came back to play scrims or even just wait for a mod to join and start a scrim. TRS was now getting around 50 CCU everyday. Once again, not very impressive numbers nowadays but at the time, this was the third most popular MPS game (with 4 a side and futsal getting around 100 ccu everyday). This was a very exciting time for me, especially as a 14 year old with no prior experiences of having their game properly recognised. Obviously this motivated me and I was working on TRS everyday, releasing daily small updates. However the biggest motivator for me at the time was robux. It sounds cringe but once again, a 14 year old who's never had more than 5k robux in his account at one singular time and not being able to buy any suddenly getting 30k robux every few weeks was crazy. I remember the first time I ever got paid for TRS, staring at my account balance of 25K robux. It was a very exciting time. Of course I didn't spend my robux in the best ways and often over paid for things (and even to this day still do) or paid crazy inflated prices on stupid things which didn't benefit me at all in the long run however that's not the topic of today is (lol).

For the next few months, TRS continued to grow and grow, surpassing MPS Futsal and MPS 4 a side for the most popular MPS game for a few months during the world cup (and for most of 2023) and behind the scenes, we were working on TRS Super Soccer. Supposed to be a massive inprovement to the current TRS game with more incentives to continue to play if you're not a league player and with brand new tools, a new map and new UI. However, long story short, it flopped. The reason why it flopped was a variation of different factors including the game being too laggy for low end devices (which is worse for TRS since a lot of the players come from poorer countries), buginess, and the gameplay being frustrating a lot of the times. We quickly uploaded a legacy version of TRS which most of the playerbase quickly returned to, however the damage inside the team was done. Work on TRS was stopped for a few months since nobody could be bothered. And who could blame us? After working on an update for over a year, just for everyone to hate the game and us being forced to revert to an older version of the game was crushing. Eventually, demofocus decided to try and keep the game alive and put out minor updates, however I couldn't be bothered to help out since I had no motivation towards maintaining TRS. I couldn't be bothered to continue writing over the old code I had wrote a year ago since it would take a lot more time than it had to, I couldn't be bothered to make a change and have the community start shouting at me because they hated it and I was bored.

Like I said at the start of this blog, I never really found MPS that fun and I never really played it as much as other developers in the community did. Consequently, I'm never really in touch with the general MPS community in terms of what makes good gameplay. To this day, I don't know what really good tools look like, I just play MPS and if I play the game enough, then that becomes my preferred toolset and I struggle on all other tool forks. Adding to this, I'm never in touch with the general 'meta' of the MPS community. When changes in the meta (new PRS update happens) do happen and every single developer scrambles to adapt their game / league to fit the new meta, I'm left behind. Since I don't play MPS that much, I'm often left in the dust as to what the new meta is and usually I discover the new change with someone pinging or dming me to change a certain thing. To be honest, I don't think there will be a real successful MPS league / game with their own radically different take on gameplay. Firstly I don't think many developers in the community are very creative to change anything except from modifying some tool powers and cooldowns and secondly, I don't think many people would take the changes very well. Since most of the top players will mainly play the top league, if any game changes something radically which they're not used to, I don't think they would bother to learn how to adjust because there's simply no need to. They're already good at the top league's game so what would be the point of readjusting to the new league's gameplay? People usually favour things they're already good at. Why would they want to readjust themselves to adapt to a new league's gameplay for not much recognition (since it's not the top league). Especially in this community where people are stubborn I think they'd just call the tools trash and then leave rather than take on a new challenge. Keep in mind this isn't exclusive to PRS, but whatever the top league at the time is. 

I'm quite bored of developing ro football games as well to be quite frank. Even though I don't really find the gameplay too fun, I find coding to be quite fun, however there's a limit. To be honest I think this is long overdue. I don't really like working on the same thing for long stretches of time, but here I am. I've been coding exclusively ro football related things for 2 almost 3 years now, and now I'm sick of it. I want to move onto something new, such as maybe a horror game, a burglary game (kind of like Notoriety / Entry Point), or a war game. I do plan on starting to work on one, however I don't really have a timeline. I want to finish working on TRS: Lite (name not final) which is a TPS: Street Soccer type game but takes inspiration from some Blue Lock games in some way with stuff like integrated air dribbling (something actually accounted for in the game), a reimagined shooting system not seen in any other ro football game, and custom physics replication (no reach, better ball transitions when getting tackled / saved, etc) before working on something new.

# Conclusion
Am I talking to a brick wall or do people actually read my yap sessions? I don't really know to be honest but if you do read my relatively unstructured blogs then uhhh hi. I only really work on stuff if I'm motivated to work on it (which only happens if I have fun while working on it). While it may seems like money is my only motivation after everything I've said in this article, it really isn't. I code for fun, not for a payment. While I do see coding as a hobby, I don't ever intend of making it a career. I've never been able to code for more than 3 hours without getting bored quickly in one sitting. In fact, I rarely code before around 5-6PM and never after 9:30PM. I don't know why I'm so picky with my routine for the time of when I start coding but I guess it's who I am. I've made a habit of of only coding between those hours and anything that doesn't sync with those tiemes gets me very bored very quickly. It's for this reason I don't ever see programming as a full time job. Coding from morning to evening is unfathomable to me and I don't ever intend to spend my entire life sitting down in front of a screen coding for hours non stop with no satisfaction. While I do want to make good games, and I find coding useful for improving my problem solving skills in general, I'm not going to devote the unfathomable amounts of time to coding (even if all most of those developers is changing prewritten numbers and pressing play and then pasting from other sources). I'm currently studying maths, sociology and economics at 6th form with no intention to switch to computer science / IT.

Anyways, enough of my yapping. I hope this told you my perspective on ro football and why I don't really want to update TRS anymore.
